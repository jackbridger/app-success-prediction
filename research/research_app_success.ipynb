    "## Introduction to the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "For many founders, their app is a core part of their offering. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I have seen with the founders I've worked with that, the app store/Play store submission is often an after thought at the end of a development sprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Founders may find themselves second guessing:\n",
    "* Which category should I be in? \n",
    "* Which of these three titles should I choose?\n",
    "* What should I include in my description?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the questions we aim to demystify in this research exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://instabug.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/appinfo.png\" alt=\"Play Store submission\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a successful app?\n",
    "\n",
    "* An app that has impact? \n",
    "* An app that lot's of people download?\n",
    "* An app that makes a lot of money?\n",
    "* An app that some people love?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not clear cut at all, but to simplify the exercise and to make it more quantifiable, we will focus on number of installations and the average user rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should provide us with a push-pull set of metrics: a hybrid approximation of reach and retention. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact approach to this could take many forms but we will start with: \n",
    "\n",
    "* TO DO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apart from the quality of the appliation/importance of our problem, what factors contribute to success? I.e. how can we optimise our app submission to maximise chance of success?\n",
    "\n",
    "[This article from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page/) provides some useful guidance on a successful app store submission. I've highlighted some of them below \n",
    "\n",
    "#### App name\n",
    "\n",
    "\"our app’s name plays a critical role in how users discover it on the App Store. Choose a simple, memorable name that is easy to spell and hints at what your app does. Be distinctive. Avoid names that use generic terms or are too similar to existing app names. An app name can be up to 30 characters long.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Provide an engaging description that highlights the features and functionality of your app. The ideal description is a concise, informative paragraph followed by a short list of main features. Let potential users know what makes your app unique and why they will love it. Communicate in the tone of your brand, and use terminology your target audience will appreciate and understand. The first sentence of your description is the most important — this is what users can read without having to tap to read more. Every word counts, so focus on your app’s unique features.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to mention an accolade, we recommend putting it at the end of your description or as part of your promotional text. Don’t add unnecessary keywords to your description in an attempt to improve search results. Also avoid including specific prices in your app description. Pricing is already shown on the product page, and references within the description may not be accurate in all countries and regions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keywords\n",
    "\"Keywords help determine where your app displays in search results, so choose them carefully to ensure your app is easily discoverable. Choose keywords based on words you think your audience will use to find an app like yours. Be specific when describing your app’s features and functionality to help the search algorithm surface your app in relevant searches. Consider the trade-off between ranking well for less common terms versus ranking lower for popular terms. Popular, functional terms such as “jobs”, “text”, or “social” may drive a lot of traffic, but are highly competitive in the rankings. Less common terms drive lower traffic, but are less competitive.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "While we may not have keywords data directly, we may indirectly look for apps that avoid generic keywords in their descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Category selection\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Be sure to select the primary category that is most relevant. Choosing categories that are not relevant to your app may cause your app to be rejected when submitted for review.\""
